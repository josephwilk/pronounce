## Data and Procedure

Pronunciations are based on the CMUdict database: http://svn.code.sf.net/p/cmusphinx/code/trunk/cmudict/

The phone list is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arpabet">ARPAbet</a> subset used by CMUdict.

CMUdict contains pronunciations of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_English">North American English</a> and ARPAbet represents the phonemes of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_American">General American English</a> so those are currently the only dialect and accent supported.

Syllables are split by scanning the pronunciation from the start to finish and applying rules of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_phonology">English phonology</a> to determine if the current phone is the start of a new syllable. Rules are defined by the rule DSL. A rule can return a boolean value or `nil` indicating that the rule doesn't apply in the context and other rules should be evaluated.

#### Declaration
```ruby
module Pronounce::SyllableRules
  rule :optional_language, 'name of rule' do |context|
    ...
  end

end
```
